# cryptoAverageBuySell
Super basic python program to keep track of average buy and sell for crypto (I guess it works for stocks too).
As the title suggests this is a little program which asks you for type of coin in the beggining, then will go into a contiual while loop,
asking whether its a buy/sell call, and what amount/price you sold or bought at. It will then simply return that average cost for the coins you have bought/sold.
Its a while loop so in order to break the loop you must type 'done' into the prompt at the beginning of the loop.
